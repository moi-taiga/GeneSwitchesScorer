#' Filter Gene Expression for Switching Genes
#'
#' @description
#' Create a reduced binary expression matrix for only the selected switching genes,
#'     binary_counts_matrix is from the sample DATA and gs_scorer_genes is from Atlas Data.
#'
#' @param binary_counts_matrix a binary expression matrix from your sample.
#' @param gs_scorer_genes Switching genes which are evenly distributed through pseudotime..
#'
#' @return a reduced binary expression matrix filtered to only include selected switching genes
#' @export
